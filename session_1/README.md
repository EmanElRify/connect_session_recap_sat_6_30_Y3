# Setting Up Python in VS Code 👩‍💻🧑‍💻

We are going to use python multiple times through classroom, activities and finally the graduation project. To set up a smooth learning workspace it is recommended to follow these steps 

## 1. Install Python

- Download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.
- **Important**: During installation, check the box that says **“Add Python to PATH”** to allow VS Code to locate the Python interpreter.
- After installation, verify it by opening a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac or Linux) and typing:

  ```bash
  python --version
- You can just install it using Microsoft Store


## 2. Install Visual Studio Code
- Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Once installed, open VS Code.

## 3. Install the Python Extension for VS Code
- Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
- Search for “Python” and install the Python extension by Microsoft. 🔍

## 4. Select the Python Interpreter
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
- Type “Python: Select Interpreter” and select it.
	- In the list of Python environments, choose the correct interpreter. It may look like:
	- On Windows: C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<version>\python.exe
